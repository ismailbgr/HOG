# HOG - Histogram of Oriented Gradients

This is a repo for the implementation of the Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOG) algorithm. The algorithm is implemented in Python and is based on the paper [Histograms of Oriented Gradients for Human Detection](http://lear.inrialpes.fr/people/triggs/pubs/Dalal-cvpr05.pdf) by Navneet Dalal and Bill Triggs.
